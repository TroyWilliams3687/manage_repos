# Manage Git Repos

Typically, when I am working on personal projects my work flow involves a number of repos for different parts of a project. Typically I am the only one working on the repositories across different machines. I wrote this script to help me out. The script will allow me to iterate recursively through a file path and find all valid repos. I can then do batch operations such as stage all unstaged changes. Commit any stage changes and push them to remote repositories. It is really quite nice. Typically I'll have private repos stored on my home computers and have remote repos on my laptops or other systems.
